## EXECUTION STEPS AND ITS OUTPUT:
Social Engineering attacks are the various cons used by the hackers to trick people into providing sensitive data to the attackers.

**Steps to Use SET for Phishing (Credential Harvester Attack Method)**

**1. Open terminal:**
```bash
sudo setoolkit
```

**2. Navigate:**
```bash
1) Social-Engineering Attacks  
2) Website Attack Vectors  
3) Credential Harvester Attack Method  
```
